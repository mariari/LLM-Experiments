#+TITLE: ObjVLisp via Claude

I want to see how prompting the agents affect Claude.

** Experiments

The =objvlisp-experiment/= directory contains all four Claude attempts at
generating an ObjVLisp-style reflective object system, along with analysis
documents comparing them to hand-written implementations.

See [[file:objvlisp-experiment/README.org][objvlisp-experiment/README.org]] for details.

Interesting attempts:

1. claude-attempt-3
   + This one via a high level description did a decent job, the code
     is kinda much with 85 lines of code but it mostly works
   + Has a few bugs in the bootstrapping but the structure is correct
   + Took over 10k tokens though
2. claude-attempt-4
   + This one started as a minimal exercise in explaining how the
     system works algorithmically
   + It's too minimal too oneshot, but it's refactors are nice and can
     help the one shot

** LLM Configuration

This repository also includes Anoma's shared LLM configuration (merged from
=anoma/llm=). See [[file:docs/README.org][docs/README.org]] for how to use the skill files.
