* ObjVlisp via claude

I want to see how promting the agnets affect claude.

Each branch represents a different starting prompt.

Interesting attempts:

1. claude-attempt-3
   + This one via a high level description did a decent job, the code
     is kinda much with 85 lines of code but it mostly works
   + Has a few bugs in the bootstrapping but the structure is correct
   + Took over 10k tokens though
2. claude-attempt-4
   + This one started as a minimal exercise in explaining how the
     system works algorithmically
   + It's too minimal too oneshot, but it's refactors are nice and can
     help the one shot
